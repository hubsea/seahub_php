# seahub_php
Global collaboration platform

##Seahub's positioning
1. Unlike GitHub, seahub is based on commercial applications
2. Unlike https://www.zbj.com, the developer of seahub is the creator of the project, a shareholder, not an employer who takes a fortune, so it needs shares.

##Seahub early developer

1. He may work at Google, Facebook, Tencent, and Ali. These are not important. Just need to participate in interesting projects on seahub and get the shares and cash rewards you deserve.

##Publisher of the seahub project
1. You may be a startup company, but with limited development capabilities, you can put some of the exploratory projects or parts of the project on the seahub. Based on agile development, the modules are subdivided at the cost of selling part of the shares and cash, developed by the seahub community. To complete the task.

2. You may only have one idea, you can also post it to seahub, form a team in the community, allocate shares, and then finance to realize your dreams.
